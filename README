What is this?

NQueueStuffer is a Windows Forms tool for generating and stuffing NServicebus 
messages on a queue. It lets the user choose an assembly and a messagetype that 
implements NServicebus.IMessage and generates a template message based on the 
messagetype. The user can then edit and stuff this message directly to a 
MSMQ queue. 

The use case for it is the times when you just need to quickly insert a known 
message into a queue and don't want the hassle of having to making a specific 
application or unit test to make it happen.  

NQueueStuffer was started by Jan Ove Skogheim Olsen.
